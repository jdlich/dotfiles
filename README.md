## Getting Started With Your Own dotfiles

After you fork this project, set the location of your dotfiles in `bashrc`:

	# bashrc
	export DOTFILES=~/Code/dotfiles

*(If your curious about the different bash files, read [this](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html))*
	
Run the install script using `rake`:

	rake install
	
## dotfiles on Github

Lastly, far greater dotfiles can be found elsewhere on GitHub: <https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories>
