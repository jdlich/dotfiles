## Getting Started With Your Own dotfiles

After you fork this project, set the location of your dotfiles in `zshrc`:

	# bashrc
	export DOTFILES=~/Code/dotfiles

*(If your curious about the different bash files, read [this](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html))*
	
Run the install script using `rake`:

	rake install
  
## More dotfiles on Github

There are more and [far greater dotfiles](https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles) out there to get ideas from.
